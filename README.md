<h1>Pokemon World</h1>



Welcome to my application, Pokemon World. Pokemon World is a fan application similar to Pokemon GO but implements battle and catch mechanics similar to the handheld games. The goal of this application is to bring the real life adventure Pokemon GO implements but retain the things that made the Pokemon Red - Sun spectacular.

The app is just developed by myself and it will take time to progress. I'm currently working on implementing battle mechanics. The code is a little messy, but when I get a working version, I will refactor and clean it up a little bit. Once the battle phase is cleaned up and implemented to an up to par standard, I will begin implementing more Pokemon moves!

Once I feel as if there are a decent number of working moves, my next goal is to create a login page so the data is retained in my database. Registration is open at kelsiegr.com and when the login page is created for the app, your accounts will be good to go.
